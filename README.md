Individual Portfolio, Data Science for Smart Environments, Wageningen University, period 5, Aniek Henken (1001640)

## Background
This portfolio is a collection of the work that I have done to accomplish my personal learning goals that I set in the beginning of the course. The complete learning goals can be read in the introduction file, in short they are as following: 

1. I want to learn how to use and make Jupyter Notebooks. 
2. I want to learn how to find and acquire web-based data.
3. I want to learn how to use the random forest algorithm for a regression analysis. 
4. I want to learn how to visualise and communicate geospatial data in an easy-to-understand way. 

The goal of the course is to apply data science in a environmental relevant context. Also with a focus on the ethical side of data science and boundary crossing competenses. Throughout the collection in my portfolio you can find both topics mentioned in the other learning goals and also in the reflection file.

## Data Sources 
- Nitrogen excretion data, population density from the Dutch Central Bureau for Statistics (CBS) 
- Weather data from de Bilt from The Royal Dutch Meteorological Institute (KNMI)
- Coordinates of German and Chinese cities and their population sizes from simplemaps.com

all the data files can be found in the CSV_files map in the repository. 

## How to use this repository 
First read the introduction file. This contains my background knowledge, the original and final personal learning goals. From here take a look at the Jupyter Notebooks in the repository and see what I did to achieve my learning goals, starting with the learninggoal2.ipynb file. Please note that there is no file for the first learning goal, but only 2-4. In each Notebook my original learning goal is stated in the beginning, and my actual learning process is described. Lastly, please look at the reflection document where i reflect on the learning process during the course, talk about my personal learning plan, and also the project outcomes. 

## Results
1. I made three different working Jupyter Notebooks.
2. In the learninggoal2.ipynb file I discuss three different types of data, where to find datasets, and look at the different applications and uses of each one.
3. In the learninggoal3.ipynb file I discuss and practice with using the random forest algorithm for a regression analysis. I trained the model to predict daily temperatures based on previous days with an accuracy of 78%. 
4. In the learninggoal4.ipynb file I practice making three different map types for the visualisation of spatial data, how to optimise them, and discuss the uses of each one. 

## Conclusions
I have accomplished all of my learning goals, but there is always more to learn. More on the reflection can be found in the reflection file in the repository, where I reflect on the course and my personal learning goals. Briefly: I would like to learn more about working with and acquiring different types of datasets (e.g. shapefiles), improve the accuracy of my random forest regression model and upgrade my visualisation skills of geospatial data in ArcGIS.
