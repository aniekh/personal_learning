Individual Portfolio, Data Science for Smart Environments, Wageningen University, period 5, Aniek Henken (1001640)

## Background
This portfolio is a collection of the work that I have done to accomplish my personal learning goals that I set in the beginning of the course. The complete learning goals can be read in the introduction file, in short they are as follows: 

1. I want to learn how to use and make Jupyter Notebooks. 
2. I want to learn how to find and acquire web-based data.
3. I want to learn how to use the random forest algorithm for a regression analysis. 
4. I want to learn how to visualise and communicate geospatial data in an easy-to-understand way. 

## Data Sources 
- Nitrogen excretion data, population density from the Dutch Central Bureau for Statistics (CBS) 
- Weather data from de Bilt from The Royal Dutch Meteorological Institute (KNMI)
- Coordinates of German and Chinese cities and their population sizes from simplemaps.com

all the data files can be found in the CSV_files map in the repository. 

## How to use this repository 
First read the introduction file. This contains my background knowledge, the original and complete personal learning goals. From here take a look at the Jupyter Notebooks in the repository and see what I did to achieve my learning goals, starting with the learninggoal2.ipynb file. Please note that there is no file for the first learning goal, but only 2-4. In each Notebook my original learning goal is stated in the beginning, and my actual learning process is described. Lastly, please look at the reflection document where i reflect on the learning process during the course, talk about my personal learning plan, and also the project outcomes. 

## Results
1. I made three different working Jupyter Notebooks.
2. In the learninggoal2.ipynb file I discuss three different types of data, where to find datasets, and look at the different applications and uses of each one.
3. In the learninggoal2.ipynb file I discuss and practice with using the random forest algorithm for a regression analysis. I trained the model to predict daily temperatures based on previous days. 
4. In the learninggoal3.ipynb file I practice making three different map types for the visualisation of spatial data, how to optimise them, and discuss the uses of each one. 

## Conclusions
I have accomplished all of my learning goals, but there is always more to learn. More on the reflection can be found in the reflection file in the repository, where I reflect on the course and my personal learning goals.
